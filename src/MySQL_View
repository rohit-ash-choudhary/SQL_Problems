--MySQL View
        A view is a database object that has no values. Its contents are based on the base table.
        It contains rows and columns similar to the real table. In MySQL, the View is a virtual table created
        by a query by joining one or more tables. It is operated similarly to the base table but does
        not contain any data of its own. The View and table have one main difference that the views are
        definitions built on top of other tables (or views). If any changes occur in the underlying table,
        the same changes reflected in the View also.

        Exmple :
            CREATE VIEW trainer AS SELECT course_name, trainer FROM courses;
